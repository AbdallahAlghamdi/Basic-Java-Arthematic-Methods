# BasicJavaArthematicMethods
Intended for showcasing some simple basics of making methods.
The program requires additional writing in the main method in order to use the three included methods.


Addon method: Arguments require an int array in which every element gets added one to.  Unlike other variables, inputting an array in a method permanently changes the insides, unlike the other variables.
DivideDoubleToInt: Arguments require two double values. They divide the first number by the second number, then cast them (force them to change the type) into a whole integer. 
addbetweenie: Arguments require two integer values and add numbers between them, whilst being inclusive of both ends.
